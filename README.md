# idle-tower-game
A litle game that I'm making out of practice and to test my skills (mainly js skills)

This is a small project to practice js, so the looks does not matter that much.
Trought this project I learned: 
	-to be more confortabel with js Objects
	-to work with local storage
	-got even more confortable with DOM

Trought this project I had problem so far with:
	-understanding setInterval()
	-making a funtion continuously repeat itself 
(I'll work on these problems)

Feel free to cop/clone/fork this repo if somthing caught your eye and want to work with this repo, and if you did something with it please send it to peterbalazs.dev@gmail.com. I'm curious what did you do with it :).
